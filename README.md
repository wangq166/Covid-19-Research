This report analyzes the characteristics of people who are more likely to be infected by Covid-19 in Toronto since 2020 and gives some suggestions to prevent from Covid-19. The results conclude that most patients can recover without any special treatment, but older people are more likely to develop the severe illness than young persons. Also, we find that the primary source of infection is traveling, and their outbreak-associated is sporadic.
